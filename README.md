# Proposal

## Title

CryptoLab

## Short description:

The CryptoLab aims to help non-technical nominators build stable and long-term cash flows via well-designed and financial tools. The core idea is that staking behavior is the same as investment behavior. Therefore nominators must first build good portfolios and then manage their portfolios as well. Portfolio management is a challenging task, especially in the complicated Kusama/Polkadot system. Via the CryptoLab, the nominators can better understand their investment performance and adjust their portfolios to gain stable profit.

## Context of the proposal: 
we aim to have as much context as possible to understand how a proposal came to the proponent's mind, Please include here:

 * any points discussed in advance in any channel related to the proposal and background research for your project. 
 * background of the proponent, team credentials. 
 * their motivation (including any conflict of interests or association to any governing bodies)
 * any known backups already behind the solution (known token holders, organizations or collectives building on Kusama Network or participating in its governance mechanism in any way).

## Problem statement: 

As Polkadot/Kusama are NPoS consensus based chains, nominators are able to nominate more than one validator, which makes staking on them complicated. When users stake on most blockchains, they just need to choose one validator and delegate their funds to them. When staking on Polkadot/Kusama, they can (and mostly have to) choose up to 24 validators. It is hard for nominators to analyse so many validators to see which ones are trustworthy and are able to earn most revenue from them.

From our observation, nominators tends to

* nominate on centralized exchanges, which hurts decentralization.
* nominate top validators on the Target page on Polkadot App, which still hurt decentralization because by doing it, funds tend to be delegated to those already have enough backups.

There are developers from the community trying to resolve the problem by providing validator ranking system and simple staking tools.

1. yieldscan (補充yieldscan在做什麼)
2. polkastats (補充polkastats做了什麼)

However, no *Portfolio Management* tools for Polkadot/Kusama nominators to track their staking revenue and validator status after nonimation.

## Proposal Objective/solution/s to point 2:

CryptoLab aims to provide a total solution for staking on Polkadot/Kusama.

We have already provided some tools on CryptoLab and also Telegram bots and have some regular users. It is time to polish the site and to work on providing a total solution on staking.

There are four top-tier goals included in this propsal.

1. Current CryptoLab website maintanence
2. Telegram Bots for both Polkadot/Kusama validators maintanence
3. CryptoLab Staking Tool
4. Telegram Bots for both Polkadot/Kusama nominators

The first two goals are focused on making what we have done better. We plan to enhance the current CryptoLab by

* Re-design the UI/UX of CryptoLab
* Move the service to AWS to improve the performance
* Maintain our Polkadot/Kusama archived node

For the Telegram Bots for validators, we plan to,

* (Maintanence and add more features to it)

The goal 3. and 4. are what we are planning to do. 

For the CryptoLab Staking Tool, we plan to,

* Design and develop Portfolio Benchmark web page to provide simple and advanced staking tools.
* Design and develop Portfolio Management web page for nominators to track (things) such as revenue, validator status and more.

For the Telegram Bots for nominators, we plan to provide the followings,

* Notify users when a validator commission is changed.
* Notify users when a validator is slashed.
* Notify users when all validators they selected are inactive.
* Regular revenue reports

so that nominators are able to make adjustment in time.
